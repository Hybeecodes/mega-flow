> A reasonably secure password generator

passwoid generates reasonably secure passwords. That's it; that's all it does.

The passwords generated by passwoid are strings of random characters. Passwords
are chosen from the set of all upper-case letters except I and O, all lower-case
letters except l, and the digits 2 through 9. 0 and O are not used to avoid
confusion with each other when passwords are displayed in sans-serif fonts. I,
l, and 1 are not used for the same reason. Passwords are guaranteed to contain
at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, and one number.

The default length is 16. The minimum length is 3, because a shorter password
would not satisfy the requirement to use all three classes of characters.
passwoid will create a password of any length of 3 or greater, and guarantees
that passwords will not repeat any characters if the requested length is 57 or
less.

## Installation

```bash
# for programmatic usage
npm install --save passwoid
# for command-line usage
npm install --global passwoid
```

## Programmatic Usage

```js
var passwoid = require('passwoid');

passwoid();  // returns a password of the default length (16)
passwoid(8); // returns a password of length 8
passwoid(1); // throws Error: Cannot generate password of length 1
```

## Command-Line Usage

```bash
$ passwoid
h6ECtbDZPnRddHV7
$ passwoid 8
XdWod8f8
$ passwoid 1
/usr/local/lib/node_modules/passwoid/lib/passwoid.js:51
    throw new Error('Cannot generate password of length ' + length);
    ^
Error: Cannot generate password of length 1
[...]
```
