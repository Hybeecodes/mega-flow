#Paginate

##A Simple JavaScript utility to provide pagination for Arrays.

* `Paginate` - Creates a new `Paginate` form a givin `Array`,
optionally with a specific `Number` of items per page.

    * `page(pageNum)` - Returns the specified page as Array.

    * `next()` - Returns the next page as Array.

    * `prev()` - Returns the previous page as Array.

    * `hasNext()` - Checks if there is a next page.


##Example:

```js
// create some fake data
var fakeData = new Array(32)
	
// create a Paginate object
var pager = new Paginate(fakeData)
	
// print all the pages
while(pager.hasNext())
	console.log(pager.next())
		
// get page 1
console.log(pager.page(1))
	
//then
console.log(pager.next()) // this will print page 2
```
